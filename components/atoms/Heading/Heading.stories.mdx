# Heading

Use this component inside other components when you need to dynamically set the heading tag that's used.
For example, a card's heading might need to be `<h2>` in one place but an `<h3>` when used somewhere else.

This component is deliberatley unstyled. Pass down class names with the `className` prop.

<Canvas>

    <Heading>This is a heading</Heading>
  </Story>
