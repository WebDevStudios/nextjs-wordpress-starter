[![WebDevStudios. Your Success is Our Mission.](https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wds-banner.png)](https://webdevstudios.com/contact/)

As of 02/27/2024, this repository has been archived and is now read-only. 

This project is outdated and no longer being maintained. WebDevStudios has developed different methods for headless WordPress projects that we may publish to a public repo in the future.  We are grateful for the engagement here, and for all contributions and discussions.

While this repository is no longer actively maintained, we're keeping it available for historical reference and for those who might still find the code useful.

For the latest on our projects and developments, please visit https://webdevstudios.com

Thank you for your support and contributions over the years. We hope you continue to find value in our past work and join us in our new ventures.

## Docutentation - Historical

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many tutorials about _"headless WordPress"_ stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into advanced functionality because: **headless WordPress is hard**.

At WebDevStudios we believe that **WordPress is so much more than a blog**-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this framework, **we've figured out the "hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.**

## Getting Started

There are two environments, the backend (WordPress) and the frontend (Next.js). Each environment has its own setup instructions.

2. [Frontend setup docs](https://webdevstudios.github.io/nextjs-wordpress-starter/docs/frontend)
