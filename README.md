A headless starter for WordPress powered by Next.js

- Next.js Demo: <https://nextjs-wordpress-starter.vercel.app/>

- Documentation: <https://webdevstudios.github.io/nextjs-wordpress-starter/>

## Introduction

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many tutorials about _"headless WordPress"_ stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into advanced functionality because: **headless WordPress is hard**.

At WebDevStudios we believe that **WordPress is so much more than a blog**-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this framework, **we've figured out the "hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.**

## Getting Started

There are two environments, the backend (WordPress) and the frontend (Next.js). Each environment has its own setup instructions.

1. [Backend setup docs](https://webdevstudios.github.io/nextjs-wordpress-starter/docs/backend)
2. [Frontend setup docs](https://webdevstudios.github.io/nextjs-wordpress-starter/docs/frontend)
