# Introduction <!-- omit in toc -->

Creating and managing content in WordPress is largely unchanged with our starter. There are no special workflows, plugins, or requirements. **Just use the Block Editor (Gutenberg) as you normally would.**

Our starter also supports: [ACF Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/), custom fields, and [Lazy Blocks](https://lazyblocks.com/)!
